# CS-230-Operating-Systems

Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
The Gaming Room client currently has a successful Android application and would like to expand their client base by having their application available to multiple operating systems. The Gaming Room wanted to have the game be available for unique teams and players and would restrict players from having multiple iterations open at a time. 

What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
I think I was most successful in determining the needs of the client and the end user and using that information to influence the decisions made throughout the design process. 

What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
I found it helpful to work through the design document because it allowed a clear direction and natural progression through the design process. 

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I would revise the suggestions portion. I would spend more time researching the advantages to the different operating systems. The sources referenced seemed to be a bit biased towards certain operating systems. 

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
I interpreted the user's needs by imagining what I would most want to see in an application. I incorporated that by considering my lack of interest in purchasing cd-roms and hard copy data and suggesting the client take advantage of cloud-based hosting options. It's important to consider the user's needs because the users will determine the success and popularity of the final product. 

How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
I approached designing software like any other project. By identifying the client's and program's major requirements, it was easier to focus my research on what operating systems would meet those needs the best.
